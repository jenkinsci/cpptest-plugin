<div>
<p>When this option is configured Hudson shows
the Parasoft C++Test analysis results in different views: historical result
trend, module and package statistics, web UI for viewing analysis
reports and warnings, and so on.</p>
<p>You need to set up your build to run C++Test in order to use
this feature - this Hudson plug-in does not perform the actual analysis!
This plug-in is not invoked for failed builds, it is only called for
stable or unstable builds (i.e., a build with failed tests).</p>
